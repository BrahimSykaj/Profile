    <p>Name: Brahim Sykaj
    <br>Location: North London </p>
    <u>
        <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
    </u>
    <p>I am someone that wants to be successful in the IT department. To do this I joined the generation program to improve my skills
    <br>in the IT department and hopefully gain an apprenticeship. I am currently doing a program by generation where in my free time
    <br>I practice my coding skills. I am currently looking for an apprenticeship which can hopefully lead to me getting the needed experience
    <br>alongside a job.</p>
    <u>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
    </u>
    <p>The experience I need is the coding experience in HTML and a coding language as well as CSS. I will get this experience from the 
    <br>generation program once I complete it. Other than the generation program, I have coded for 1 year in college and another 2 years
    <br>in secondary school. The programming language I was learning was python. I was also taught some HTML in college as well as CSS.
